"""
Conversation Extractor v2 — extracts RICH knowledge from conversations.

Extracts:
1. Entities (person, project, technology, company, concept)
2. Facts — short assertions
3. Relations — connections between entities
4. Knowledge — solutions, formulas, recipes, configs, commands (with artifacts)

Knowledge is the killer feature. LLM determines the knowledge type:
  [solution] — problem solution (code, config)
  [formula] — formula, equation
  [treatment] — treatment, prescription
  [experiment] — experiment result
  [recipe] — recipe (cooking, process)
  [decision] — decision made
  [command] — useful command / instruction
  [reference] — link, source
  [insight] — observation, insight
  [example] — example, case
  ... any other type that fits the context

EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """You are a knowledge extraction system. Extract personal knowledge from ALL speakers in the conversation.

Return ONLY valid JSON without markdown.

WHO TO EXTRACT ABOUT:
- Extract facts about ALL people mentioned — both speakers share equally important information
- Extract identity, preferences, activities, relationships, plans, events for every person
- If someone says "I went to a support group" — extract it as a fact about THAT person
- DO NOT extract: generic knowledge the AI assistant explained (unless a person confirmed they use it)
- If a person says "I"/"me"/"my" — resolve to their name if known, otherwise "User"
{existing_context}
ENTITY RULES:
- Named entities with 1+ extractable facts (people, places, organizations, activities, projects)
- entity_type: person, project, technology, company, concept, place, activity
- Create separate entities for each person by name
- Single-fact entities are OK if the fact is important (identity, job, location, hobby)

ENTITY NAMING:
- EXACT casing from context: "Mengram" not "MENGRAM", "PostgreSQL" not "postgresql"
- FULL name when known: "Ali Baizhanov" not "Ali", "Uzum Bank" not "uzum"
- If entity already exists above — use EXACT SAME NAME (do not create duplicates)

FACT RULES:
- Concise but complete, under 20 words
- ALWAYS include dates/times when mentioned or inferrable from context
  GOOD: "attended LGBTQ support group on May 7, 2023"
  GOOD: "started pottery class in June 2023"
  GOOD: "works as a software engineer at Google"
  BAD: "attended support group" (date was available but omitted!)
- If the conversation includes timestamps like "[1:56 pm on 8 May, 2023]" and someone says "yesterday" — calculate the actual date and include it
- ONLY facts that DIRECTLY describe the entity they're assigned to
- Keep project facts on projects, personal facts on the person — don't mix
- DO NOT extract: meta-conversation actions ("asked a question", "sent a message", "said hello")
- Facts can optionally include a "when" date field (see format below)

FACT DEDUP — check existing facts above. Do NOT re-extract facts that already exist (even if worded slightly differently).
If someone says "I use Python" and existing context already has "uses Python" → skip it.
If someone says "I switched from React to Svelte" and existing has "uses React" → extract "switched to Svelte" (this is NEW info).

EPISODIC MEMORY — extract events and interactions:
- An episode = something that HAPPENED: an activity, decision, milestone, trip, class, meetup, achievement
- Extract any event worth remembering — err on the side of inclusion
- Include: what happened (summary), details (context), result (outcome), who was involved (participants)
- Include "happened_at" date if known from conversation context (e.g. "2023-05-07")
- emotional_valence: positive, negative, neutral, mixed
- importance: 0.3 (minor) to 0.9 (major milestone)
- Do NOT create episodes for pure greetings or small talk with no content

PROCEDURAL MEMORY — extract workflows/processes:
- A procedure = a repeatable sequence of steps someone performs or described
- Only extract if there are 2+ concrete steps forming a workflow
- Include: name, trigger (when to use it), steps (ordered actions)
- Link to entities involved
- Extract from IMPLICIT workflows too ("first I do X, then Y, then Z")
